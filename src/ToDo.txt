ARCHITECTURE
- Seperate Quadraverb code into gui_quad_gt and midi_quad_gt modules
- Put queue routines into queue module

GUI
- Rescan for MIDI devices when user clicks on device lists?
- Provide titles for various quadraverb forms
- Disable/enable send/get buttons based on MIDI open status

MIDI
- Resolve code for closing MIDI channels
- Queue up rx'd messages for processing                                      -> Dummy queue done
- Process rx'd messages in a seperate thread

QUADRAVERB
- Check message is from a Quadraverb                                         -> Done
- Decode patch number                                                        -> Done
- Decode contents of message
- Message encoder                                                            -> Done, use it
- Request all patches (handy for testing callback routine)                   -> Done, interpret

Problems:
- MIDI close gets continuous MM_LONGMSG messages
- Program hangs at close (as at V25)
