ARCHITECTURE
- Seperate Quadraverb code into gui_quad_gt and midi_quad_gt modules
- Put queue routines into queue module
- Clean up return codes and error handling

GUI
- Rescan for MIDI devices when user clicks on device lists?
- Provide titles for various quadraverb forms
- Disable/enable send/get buttons based on MIDI open status

MIDI
- Resolve code for closing MIDI channels
- Queue up rx'd messages for processing                                      -> Dummy queue done
- Process rx'd messages in a seperate thread

QUADRAVERB
- Check message is from a Quadraverb                                         -> Done
- Decode patch number                                                        -> Done
- Decode contents of message
- Check if funtion #'s 0,5 and 6 work for "Program", "Midi" and "Store"      -> Done apart from encoding
- See if we can request and read the ROM version
- Message encoder                                                            -> Done, use it
- Request all patches (handy for testing callback routine)                   -> Done

Problems:
- MIDI close gets continuous MM_LONGDATA messages
- Program hangs at close (as at V18, V17 ok, V20 worse)
  - To reporoduce:
    - Start program
    - Open MIDI (must have Midi Out and Midi In devices, GS Wavetable (Out) and USB (in) will cause prob.)
    - Exit
    - Program crashed (V18) or hangs (V20)
- Encode routine is wrong
